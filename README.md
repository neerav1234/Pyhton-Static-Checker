# Lexer & Parser

This is a Static Checker for python that takes a python program and perform static checks on it(eg, syntax error, report type mismatches, whether a variable is being used without initialisation/declaration etc.)


To test the working of the Static Checker run the StaticChecker.py program using python3 with the file to check as argument as:

``` shell
python3 StaticChecker.py { filename.py }
```
